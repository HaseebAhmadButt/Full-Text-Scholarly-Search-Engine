/*
In Spring Cloud, API Gateway is a server-side component that acts as an entry point for all external
requests that are made to your microservices' architecture. It sits between the clients (such as mobile
applications, web applications, or other services) and the backend services, providing a single point of
entry and a unified interface for all of your services.

The API Gateway is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate microservices, aggregating the
responses from multiple microservices, and handling cross-cutting concerns such as authentication,
authorization, rate limiting, and caching.

Spring Cloud Gateway is a popular API Gateway implementation in the Spring ecosystem.
It is built on top of Spring WebFlux and provides a flexible, reactive, and easy-to-configure way of
building API Gateway functionality in your microservices' architecture.

With Spring Cloud Gateway, you can define routes using a variety of criteria, such as URI, headers,
or request parameters, and you can apply a variety of filters to incoming requests, such as logging,
rate limiting, and circuit breaking. Additionally, you can integrate Spring Security for authentication
and authorization, and you can use a variety of Spring Cloud components, such as Service Discovery
and Circuit Breaker, to build a robust and fault-tolerant API Gateway.
